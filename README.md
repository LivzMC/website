# LivzMC

> A website designed to display Minecraft profiles, skins and capes.

LivzMC is a passion project of mine and maintaining this for years was never a plan, it's just something that happened. The idea was to learn how databases worked, and how to fetch data from an external API and save it, and other basic practices in web development.
The idea for saving and displaing Minecraft profiles was from another popular website called [NameMC](https://namemc.com).

Now, LivzMC is more than that. It hosts [OptiFine's](https://optifine.net/donate) banner editor, it also saves OptiFine cape histories so that you can see people's banner URLs. It also hosts another project of mine which is OptiFine ported to snapshots. [More info](https://livzmc.net/optikai)

## Contributing

The idea of opening LivzMC's source code is so that people can learn from it's code and for people to easily contribute.
